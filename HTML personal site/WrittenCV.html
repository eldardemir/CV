<p class="CV">Dear Hiring Manager, 
    I am Eldar Demir, I am a third-year student at International University Sarajevo (IUS), department of 
    Software Engineering. From primary school I have been interested in programming, I went to a 
    contest with my school for programming in QBasic. I went to Elektrotehnicka high school in Sarajevo, 
    and my life wish from primary school was to be a programmer. I have knowledge of C++, C, Java, 
    HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery,Node.js,Express.Js,SQL and Databases and I would like to 
    expand my knowledge in programming. I am very interested in a full-time job in your company with 
    reflexive working hours because of faculty. I think that practical knowledge is important just as 
    theoretical knowledge. I think that this job would be a great opportunity for me to learn more about 
    the job itself. Just listening, and talking to people that have more knowledge than me would be 
    beneficial for me and my knowledge about programming. As a student a full-time job would be 
    beneficial for the improvement of my financial situation, it would be helpful for paying for my college 
    tuition. I am ready to learn and to work for the self-improvement, and improvement of your 
    company. I am persistent and when I take a task to do I do not stop until it is done. I have knowledge 
    in Bosnian language, I have knowledge in English language, all of my subjects in college are based on 
    english language so i will not have a problem with understanding tasks in English language. I am good 
    at teamwork, so it would not be a problem for me to work in a group. I am aware of my knowledge, 
    and that i need a lot of work. I am also aware that i am juniot at this job and that i need a lot of work 
    to improve.I am ending this application by the quote of Alan Turing â€žProgramming is a skill best 
    acquired by practice and example, rather than from books. All best, Eldar</p>
